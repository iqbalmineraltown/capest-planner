You are implementing enhancements to `/pages/board.vue` for a capacity planning application.

Read the current file first, then implement these changes:

1. **Add new state:**
   - Add `const initialStartWeek = ref<number>(1)` to track the pre-filled start week from drag-drop

2. **Update handleAddAssignment:**
   - The payload now includes `startWeek` from the week-cell drop
   - Update the function to extract `startWeek` and set `initialStartWeek.value`
   ```typescript
   function handleAddAssignment(payload: { initiative: Initiative; memberId?: string; role?: string; startWeek?: number } | Initiative) {
     if ('memberId' in payload && payload.memberId) {
       selectedInitiative.value = payload.initiative
       editingAssignmentIndex.value = -1
       editingAssignment.value = null
       initialMemberId.value = payload.memberId
       initialRole.value = payload.role || ''
       initialStartWeek.value = payload.startWeek || 1  // Add this
     } else {
       const initiative = 'initiative' in payload ? payload.initiative : payload
       selectedInitiative.value = initiative
       editingAssignmentIndex.value = -1
       editingAssignment.value = null
       initialMemberId.value = ''
       initialRole.value = ''
       initialStartWeek.value = 1  // Reset to default
     }
     showAssignmentDialog.value = true
   }
   ```

3. **Update AssignmentDialog component props:**
   - Add `:initial-start-week="initialStartWeek"` prop
   - Add `:all-initiatives="initiativesStore.initiatives"` prop
   - Add `:exclude-initiative-id="selectedInitiative?.id"` prop
   - Add `:exclude-assignment-index="editingAssignmentIndex"` prop

4. **Reset initialStartWeek after save/delete:**
   - Reset `initialStartWeek.value = 1` in both `handleSaveAssignment` and `handleDeleteAssignment`

This is a Nuxt.js 3 + Vue 3 + Vuetify 3 project using Composition API with `<script setup lang="ts">`.
