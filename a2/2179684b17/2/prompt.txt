Update /Users/iqbal/projects/capest-planner/components/board/BoardRow.vue to work with smooth drag-and-drop using @formkit/drag-and-drop.

Read the current file at /Users/iqbal/projects/capest-planner/components/board/BoardRow.vue first.

Key changes needed:
1. Import { useBoardDragDrop } from '~/composables/useBoardDragDrop'
2. Replace the native drag event handlers with the composable's state management
3. Use the composable's dragState to check what's being dragged
4. Update handleWeekDragOver to use the composable's setDropTarget
5. Update handleWeekDrop to use the composable's handleDropOnWeek
6. Keep the visual feedback classes (drag-over-week, drop-zone-indicator)
7. Pass isDragging prop to AssignmentCell components
8. For assignment reordering within the same week, use @formkit/drag-and-drop

The composable provides:
- dragState: current drag state (member or assignment)
- isDragging: computed boolean
- setDropTarget(initiativeId, week): set current drop target
- isDropTarget(initiativeId, week): check if cell is drop target
- handleDropOnWeek(initiative, week): handle the drop action
- endDrag(): clear drag state

Make sure to maintain all existing functionality while integrating the new smooth drag system.
