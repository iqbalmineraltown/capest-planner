You are implementing enhancements to `/components/board/CapacityBoard.vue` for a capacity planning application.

Read the current file first, then implement these changes:

1. **Pass allInitiatives to BoardRow:**
   - The BoardRow component now needs an `allInitiatives` prop for warning calculations
   - Pass `allInitiatives` from `initiativesStore.initiatives` to each BoardRow

2. **Update drop-member handler:**
   - The `handleDropMember` function now receives `startWeek` in the payload
   - Update the emit signature to include `startWeek` in the `add-assignment` event

3. **Update emit signature:**
   - Change `'add-assignment': [payload: { initiative: Initiative; memberId: string; role: string }]` to include `startWeek: number`

4. **Update BoardRow template binding:**
   - Add `:all-initiatives="initiativesStore.initiatives"` to the BoardRow component

The updated emit should be:
```typescript
emit('add-assignment', {
  initiative: payload.initiative,
  memberId: payload.memberId,
  role: payload.role,
  startWeek: payload.startWeek,
})
```

This is a Nuxt.js 3 + Vue 3 + Vuetify 3 project using Composition API with `<script setup lang="ts">`.
