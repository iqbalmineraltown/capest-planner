Update /Users/iqbal/projects/capest-planner/components/board/CapacityBoard.vue to work with smooth drag-and-drop using @formkit/drag-and-drop.

Read the current file at /Users/iqbal/projects/capest-planner/components/board/CapacityBoard.vue first.

Key changes needed:
1. Import { useBoardDragDrop } from '~/composables/useBoardDragDrop'
2. Replace native drag handlers (handleDragStart, handleDragEnd) with the composable
3. Use dragAndDrop from '@formkit/drag-and-drop/vue' to initialize smooth dragging on member pool cards
4. The member pool cards should have:
   - class="member-pool-card draggable-item"
   - Remove :draggable="true" and native @dragstart/@dragend handlers
   - Use the composable's startMemberDrag when drag starts
5. Pass the composable's dragState to BoardRow as :dragged-member
6. Update styles for smooth animations:
   - .member-pool-card with smooth transitions
   - .member-pool-card.dragging with scale and shadow effects
   - Use cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) easing

The composable provides:
- startMemberDrag(member): start dragging a member
- endDrag(): clear drag state
- dragState: reactive drag state object

Maintain all existing visual feedback and capacity indicators.
