You are implementing enhancements to `/components/board/BoardRow.vue` for a capacity planning application.

Read the current file first, then implement these changes:

1. **Week-cell specific drop targets:**
   - Add `isDragOverWeek` ref to track which specific week cell is being hovered
   - Add drag handlers to individual week `<td>` elements: `@dragover.prevent`, `@dragleave`, `@drop.prevent`
   - Create `handleWeekDragOver(event, week)`, `handleWeekDragLeave()`, `handleWeekDrop(event, week)` functions
   - Update emit to include `startWeek` in `drop-member` payload
   - Add CSS class `.drag-over-week` for visual feedback on hovered week cell

2. **Add props:**
   - Add `allInitiatives: Initiative[]` prop (for warning calculations across all initiatives)

3. **Warning indicators:**
   - Import `getInitiativeWarnings` from `~/utils/capacityCalculator`
   - Add computed `warnings` that calls `getInitiativeWarnings(props.initiative, props.members, props.allInitiatives, props.quarter?.id || '')`
   - Display a warning chip (v-chip with mdi-alert icon) when `warnings.hasWarnings` is true
   - Show tooltip with details: over-capacity members, unfilled roles, and week conflicts

4. **Role progress indicators:**
   - Import `getRoleFulfillment` from `~/utils/capacityCalculator`
   - Add computed `roleFulfillment` that calls `getRoleFulfillment(props.initiative)`
   - Replace the simple role requirement chips with progress indicators showing:
     - Role chip with color
     - Progress bar (v-progress-linear) showing percentage
     - Text showing "X/Yw" format (assigned/required weeks)

The emit signature should be updated to:
```typescript
'drop-member': [payload: { initiative: Initiative; memberId: string; role: string; startWeek: number }]
```

Make sure to import ` Initiative` type from `~/types`.

This is a Nuxt.js 3 + Vue 3 + Vuetify 3 project using Composition API with `<script setup lang="ts">`.
